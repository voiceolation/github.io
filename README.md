### Description

In this project, our goal is to extract the vocals from all kinds of tracks. Although  equivalent software exists, most of them lack isolating vocals perfectly or they are focused only on acoustic human voices despite modern music includes vocaloids, stereo vocal channels, panned vocals, or autotunes. We intend to reach harder aspects of the isolation, like isolating vocals from the stereo mix. We are aiming to use phase cancellation for extraction of desired frequency range. Achieving the phase cancellation requires using time-frequency related transform functions such as Fourier transformation to get frequency domain, then observing frequencies and applying invert wave cycles to neutralize unwanted voices.
