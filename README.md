### Description

Voiceolation is a music source separator that extracts vocals from songs. Voiceolation is not only used for remixing or editing but also used for music information retrieval (MIR) in order to define and brand music genres. The music information retrieval  has become a more important part for some well known companies like Spotify, Facebook, and Deezer. They already have some projects on music separation techniques to expand MIR views for example, genre classification, identify vocals and language, etc.
